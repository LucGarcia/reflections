When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you don't always access it from the same computer.
When other people contribute to the project.
When you want other people to see it (e.g. open source project).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not want to pull all your changes, this way you can select when and which changes to update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of a repository that are made directly from one GitHub account to another. They are useful when we want to work on a repository without access to the remote or permission to make changes. 
Clones are copies of a repository made within a computer or between GitHub and a local computer. They are useful when we want to work on a project collaborating with others through GitHub, or just share it.
Branches are divergences made within a repository. They are useful when we want to add changes while keeping the original master branch unaffected.
