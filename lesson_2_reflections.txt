What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A git archive is created within the directory. 
It is needed so that we can save versions using commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a provisional file. 
It allows you to select what changes you want to commit.
You don't need to save all the files and you will see exactly what changed using git diff.
