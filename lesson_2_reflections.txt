What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A git archive is created within the directory. 
It is needed so that we can save versions using commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a provisional file. 
It allows you to select what changes you want to commit.
You don't need to save all the files and you will see exactly what changed using git diff.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check the staging area using git status to make sure the files in there respond to one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When introducing a feature or change that we are not sure is going to work. 
when creating different versions of the same project.
Branches allow working in different side projects at the same time, all of them being operative.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They are a visual map of the branches. 
They help you keep track of how many branches and commits you create.
They help you maintain a logical structure.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The secondary branch and all changes made in it are added to the main branch.
The end(tip) of the main branch becomes the end (tip) of the secondary branch as well.
The commits made in both branches are visible from the main branch log.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pros:
	It saves time and effort.
	If there are conflicts, they are easy to detect in the code.
Cons:
	If there are errors or bugs not detected as conflicts, they will pass to the commit.
